    CODEOWNERS out of date. Run `codeowners generate` to update the CODEOWNERS file

    Code ownership should only be defined for each file in one way. The following files have declared ownership in multiple ways

    gems/payroll_calculator/calculator.rb
     owner: Payments
      - Owner annotation at the top of the file
     owner: Payroll
      - Owner specified in Team YML's `owned_gems`

    ruby/app/services/multi_owned.rb
     owner: Payments
      - Owner annotation at the top of the file
     owner: Payroll
      - Owner specified in `ruby/app/services/.codeowner`

    Found invalid team annotations
    - ruby/app/models/blockchain.rb is referencing an invalid team - 'Web3'

    Some files are missing ownership
    - ruby/app/unowned.rb
